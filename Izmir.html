		Once the ancient city of <b><i>Smyrna, Izmir</i></b> is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains. The broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although <b><i>the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.</i></b><br><br>
		
		Izmir owes its position as an economically and socially dynamic city to its location, climate and the fact that it has been a home to many different cultures and religions. <b><i>Persians, Ancient Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans</i></b> are just a few of the dozens of different civilizations that the city has hosted throughout its long history.<br><br>

		<b><i>Under Suleyman the Magnificent</i></b>, Smyrna became a thriving and sophisticated city and a huge trading center, despite its frequent earthquakes. It was a cosmopolitan city , with a Greek Orthodox majority along with Armenians, Jews and Muslims. Numerous languages could be heard in the streets, spoken by locals and visiting traders.<b><i> Following World War I </b></i>and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, and on the basis of the majority Greek population in the area, Greece was granted a mandate over Izmir from the Allies. Athens took control over the whole of the Aegean region.<br><br>
		
		Rising tensions led the outbreak of war as <b><i>the Greeks purshed further into the heart of Anatola</i></b> in an attempt to unite the Greek communities of Asia Minor. Led by Kemal Ataturk the Turkish army launched a counter-attack and seized the city. <b><i>Ataturk formally took Izmir on 9 September 1922</i></b>, which is celebrated as the day of the city's liberation.

There is a restaurant located on the top of the elevator with a bird-eye view of Izmir.<br>
